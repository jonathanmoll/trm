Question 1. Explain the difference between implied and historical volatility:

Implied volatility is derived from current option prices by solving for the volatility using for example
the Black-Scholes formula. As a result, the implied volatility captures expectations for future volatility of the asset.

On the other hand, historical volatility uses historical data to measure the historical volatility of the asset over
some period of time. This does not contain information about future volatility expectations.
